# ⏳ Sand Simulation using Pygame

Vibe coded (well almost) a simple sand simulator inspired by the YT channel
[the coding train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain)  using PyGame. 

The project was made using the [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager.

***Press ```C``` to change the colour of the sand.***

The current behaviour is if you press ```C``` on your keyboard, a random colour is assigned to the sand.
The default colour is white.
Here's a short demo vid ⏯️

-- *maybe I will add (or vibe code) some more functionalities into it in the future*
